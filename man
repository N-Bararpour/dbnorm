\value{
Several graphs compiled into a \bold{PDF} file which are a \emph{correlation} plot for each of applied models, a grouped \emph{barplot} presenting the maximum variability associated with batch levels in the raw and the corrected datasets.\cr
Files saved as \bold{csv} in the working directory are a dataset corrected via either of applied models. Also, a two column matrix for Adjusted R-Square for raw and corrected datasets and a table summarizing the score values presented in \emph{barplot}.

\description{
This function gives a quick notification about the performance of the statistical models implemented in the \code{dbnorm} package such as \emph{Giordan (2013)} and/or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric as described by \emph{Johnson et al.(2007)} and in \emph{sva} package by \emph{Leek et al.(2012)}. It calculates and plots adjusted coefficient of determination or \emph{Adjusted R-Squared} for each variable estimated in a regression model for its dependency to the batch level in the raw data and treated data via either of those models. Immediately, a score calculated based on the maximum variability explained by the batch level presents the performance of applied models. This score notifies the consistency of a model performance for all detected features (variables), facilitating quick comparison of the models for selecting one of those models, which is more appropriate to the data structure. This function is suggested for less than 2000 features (variables) to keep maximum computational speed.\cr

This function allows you to adjust the data for across batch signal drift or batch effect  using two-stage procedure approach as described by \emph{M.Giordan (2013)}.\emph{dbnormBer} includes advanced statistical tools to inspect the structure and quality of high throughput experiment both in macroscopic and microscopic scales at the level of sample sets and metabolic feature, respectively. Notably, using this function users applied unsupervised learning algorithm to visualize the most variance explained by the two first components in the different set of samples analyzed in the entire experiment in the raw and corrected data. In parallel, linear association of feature (variable) and batch level has been estimated and visualized by a correlation plot. In fact, estimated \emph{Adjusted- R squared} is considered to define the level of dependency of feature ( variable) to the batch level in the raw and corrected datasets. Besides, for quick notification about the performance of the applied model a maximum variability detected in either of datasets is reported as a score. This score notify the consistency of model performance for all detected features (variables).\cr
