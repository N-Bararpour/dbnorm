\title{Adjusted coefficient of determination for a data normalized for across batch signal drift}
\usage{
ACDdbnorm(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A data frame in which rows define the independent experiments (samples) and columns the features (variables).Batch order must be framed in the first column.}
}
\value{
A two columns matrix, for each applied model, consisting of the name of the variables (features) with the corresponding Adjusted R-squared value in \emph{csv} format saved in the working directory. In parallel, two distinct bar plots for the scores given to the total variability and maximum variability with respect to each treatment algorithm compiled into \emph{pdf} together with the corresponding exact value presented in the table and saved in \emph{csv}.
}
\description{
This function gives a quick notification about the performance of the statistical models implemented in the \code{dbnorm} package such as \emph{Giordan (2013)} and/or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric as described by \emph{Johnson et al.(2007)} and in \emph{sva} package by \emph{Leek et al.(2012)}. It calculates adjusted coefficient of determination or \emph{Adjusted R-Squared} for each variable estimated in a regression model for its dependency to the batch level in the raw data and treated data via either of those models. Immediately, the performance of applied models are presented by two scores calculated based on the total degree of variability and maximum variability explained by the batch level for each variables. Which respectively notify the overall performance of a model and the consistency of model performance for all detected variables (features), facilitating quick comparison of the models for selecting one of those models, which is more appropriate to the data structure. This function is suggested for less than \emph{2k} features.\cr
