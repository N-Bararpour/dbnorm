\arguments{
\item{m}{An array or a matrix}
}
\value{
A matrix with estimated missing value.

\description{
It returns to a matrix of data in which missing values are estimated. By this function, all Zero values are first replaced by NA values, which are then replaced by the lowest detected value on the column margin. This function is applicable in all sort of high-throughput experiments. In a metabolomics workflow, it is suggested for a targeted approach where variables (features) measured at specific mass to charge transition.
