\title{Visualization of analytical heterogeneity on the profile of variables (features) in ComBat-Parametric -corrected data}
\usage{
profplotpcom(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A data frame in which rows define the independent experiments (samples) and columns the features (variables).Batch order must be framed in the first column.}
}
\value{
Original dataset in \emph{csv} format together with the series of profile plot for the variables( features) in the sample sets analyzed in the entire experiment provided by the \bold{Scatter} plot,\bold{Violin} plot and \bold{Density} plot compiled into \emph{pdf}.
}
\description{
\emph{profplotpcom} allows you to adjust the data for batch effect using Parametric Empirical Bayes approach as described by \emph{Johnson et al.(2007)} and via \emph{sva} package as explained by \emph{Leek et al.(2012)}, and informs you about the presence of across batch signal drift or batch effect in the treated data, determined by the shifted \emph{probability density function} plots (\emph{pdf} plots) of variables (features) detected in an experiment.\cr

\details{
Zero and NA values are not allowed. Optionally missing value can be imputed functions implemented in \code{dbnorm} package. Input must be normalized and transformed beforehand.

\examples{

batch<- rep(gl(3,7,labels = c(1:3),1))
y<- matrix(rnorm(2100),nrow=21)
